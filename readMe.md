<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In today's fast paced world it is incredibly difficult to stay on top of everything. Not anymore! With this new technology you can not only write notes anywhere that you can open a web app but you can also save them and refer back to them in the future. I know what you're thinking "but there will be so many notes since I take them daily." WRONG, this web app comes with a built in DELETE function to help you stay clutter free! Now you have no excuse but to succeed!
